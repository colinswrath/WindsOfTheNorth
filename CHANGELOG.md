## 1.1.7

Key Info

 - This update is Save-Safe (from 1.1.0+ Only)
 - Not save safe if upgrading from pre 1.1.0 versions
 - If you were having issues loading up the game with Skills of Sneaking or Items Stolen Bugfix, please be sure you have followed the install instructions and installed VC++. (I made sure I updated the link)

<Details>
<summary>Patch Notes</summary>

### Misc Changes

 - The list now uses Aetherius' Breton Spell Absorb plugin
 - With the addition of CSSET as a base, I do not feel the need to bloat the list's size with PC - Clutter so that has been removed.
 - Community Shaders - Water Caustics have been disabled by default due to repeated reports of majorly impacted performance. It is still present in the list and may optionally be enabled again if you desire to do so

### Bug Fixes

 - I discovered that with post 7.0.0 versions of SPID, the visiting advisor outfit tweak distro just magically stopped working. I could not get it to work no matter which permutation of configuration I tried. It worked okay with pre 7.0.0 versions of SPID. Therefore, I switched the mod over to using SkyPatcher runtime distribution and it worked like a charm without issues.
 - Fixed an issue with Falas Selvayn not selling anything but the Stag Prince Bow (Thank Delta for helping me fix this)
 - Fixed an issue where torches are invisible when equipped
 - Fixed a bug in Starfrost that caused hunger not to show in UI

### Balance Changes

 - The extra plots added by CC Farming TNE are no longer available for purchase (it had up to 121 plots available which is..alot)
 - Silver Hand armor is now equivilant to Steel Armor instead of roughly Steel Plate

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Patch Notes</summary>

### Misc
 
 - Custom Window was added, with custom icon art provided by Komegaki
 - Made some changes to the default IED preset to disable some things by default listed below:
      - Stamina, Magicka, Health, White Phile Potion/Holder
      - Elder Scrolls
      - Horn of Jurgen Windcaller/Holder
      - Azura's Star
      - Back Skulls
      - Dragon Claws
      - Dragonstone
      - Hip Bone
      - Jagged Crown

      - Left Skull
      - Right Skull
      - Satchels
      - All Instruments
      - All coin pouches
 - If you want the new IED presets to take effect on an existing save, you will need to import the default config by doing the following
     - Press backspace in game
     - Select file -> Default Config -> import
     - Make sure the user radio button is selected (should be by default)
     - Select "Ok" and then "Ok" again
 - A new utility mod of my own making called "Modlist Maintenance" has been added. It keeps track of the current modlist version on your save among other things. From this point onward (meaning with future save unsafe updates), It will tell you if you've updated to a save unsafe version, it will tell you when it performs updates, and also has the ability to refresh spells on the player upon updating.
 - I am still keeping modlist update checker, as its functionality includes the ability to reach out to see if there are any available updates, which is different than my DLL above.
 - True Directional Movement: Now by default 360 degree movement is only active with your weapon unsheathed.

### Bug Fixes

 - Fixed an issue that was allowing a Glass Battleaxe to spawn in Khajiit caravan lists
