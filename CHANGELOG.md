## 1.0.7

Key Info

 - This update is Save-Safe

<Details>
<summary>Patch Notes</summary>

### Misc
 - Several of the custom patches are now hosted on the nexus modlist page instead of being included directly in the list
 - LOD is now nexus hosted as well, which should provide faster/more consistent downloads
 - Reverted Schoolsacks of Simonrim's change to mark some bags as unplayable to fix existing saves having invisible inventory bags. (Crafting recipes should still not be accessible)
 - Many of the Cathedral 3D plants were removed. Not because they dont look good (they look great), but because visually they are pretty inconsistant with the rest of the list and stand out quite a bit.

### Balance Changes
 - Timing is Everything - Ebony Warrior quest start level requirement was changed from level 80 to level 50 (50 is the Crusader uncapper "soft" cap)
 - Kachunk consistency adjustments: Elven and Ebony crossbows are no longer locked behind Dawnguard. (Enhanced versions still are)
 - Kachunk consistency adjustments: Nordic crossbow requires intermediate smithing instead of advanced smithing. (For Adamant consistency)

Apologies for the inconvenience.
