If you have any issues during installation, or otherwise, please check the troubleshooting guide (linked below) first to see if your question is answered there. I provide support and bugfixing to the best of my ability. 
<br>
Please keep in mind I am still a one man show. Not only do I maintain this list (bug fixing, documentation, support, etc), I maintain quite a few mods on top of real life obligations.

## Bug Reports

If your question is not answered in the troubleshooting guide, or you encounter any bugs while playing the list, you can join the [Lost Outpost Discord server](https://discord.gg/WF66mMu) for support (Look for the Winds-of-the-north discussion channel and/or the Support forum).

## Can I add mods to this list?

Once you have Winds of the North installed, it functions as any normal manually created modlist would. "Its a free country" and I am not here to police your activities.

***However***, it is important to remember that support will **not** be provided to modified versions of Winds of the North. Adding new mods on top of the already patched list may cause bugs, even in ways you don't always expect it to.\
As mentioned before, I am one guy and I am not a machine. I cannot possibly know how every mod out there interacts with the list.

I will state again to be clear, modifying the modlist forfeits support.
