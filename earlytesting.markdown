# Important

<div class="centerdiv">
  <hr class="thin-hr">
</div>

Before going any futher, there are a few very important things to keep in mind.

- Disclaimer: Any versions of the modlist linked on this page are TEST VERSIONS. You may encounter bugs. you may encounter issues. Pre-releases are not intended for very long term stable use.
- The purpose of these pre-releases is to assist with identifying any issues ahead of a full release, hopefully resulting in releases that contain fewer glaring bugs and issues.
- I cannot guarantee that any save made on a pre-release of the modlist will be compatible with the future full release or other pre-releases. You should assume that saves will not be compatible with the next release unless I state otherwise here on this page.
- Please keep in mind that any information outside of this page may not hold true for pre-releases. ie. Details on the Creation Club Integration page, or the gameplay guide will only ever be correct for full releases.
- Finally, please do not modify pre-releases. These are meant to help identify bugs and other issues with the list. They are not intended for long term play. Its a waste of my time, and yours, to install other mods on top of a pre-release and then make posts reporting issues. 

# Reporting Bugs and Issues

<div class="centerdiv">
  <hr class="thin-hr">
</div>

As I stated above, these pre-releases are intended help identify bugs ahead of time. This means you all need a place to make reports.

The best place for this is the **[Lost Outpost Discord server](https://discord.gg/WF66mMu)**. 
<br>
You should open a support post there detailing as much about the bug as you can. And please, for Talos' sake, mention that you are using a pre-release version of the modlist.

# Pre-Releases

[Winds of the North - 3.0.0 Alpha 1](https://github.com/colinswrath/WindsOfTheNorth/releases/download/3.0.0a1/Winds.of.the.North.wabbajack)

[Winds of the North - 3.0.0 Alpha 2](https://github.com/colinswrath/WindsOfTheNorth/releases/download/3.0.0a2/Winds.of.the.North.wabbajack)

## How to Install

<div class="centerdiv">
  <hr class="thin-hr">
</div>

Because this is an early test version, its not the same version that you would get directly through the Wabbajack UI.

You can install this test version by following the steps below:

1. Download the test version linked above.
2. If you don't have Wabbajack installed, download it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/403) and install it. Otherwise, open Wabbajack.
3. Click on the "Browse Lists" button on the left.
4. Click on "Install from Disk" at the top right.
5. Select the "Winds of the North.wabbajack" file that you downloaded in step 1.
6. After the UI pulls up the list, select an install location
7. Click the install button at the bottom right and wait for the list to install.


## Things to Look For

<div class="centerdiv">
  <hr class="thin-hr">
</div>

Beyond looking for general bugs and the like, there are a few things that I am specifically looking to test. 
<br>
I will list these here to assist in focusing testing efforts.

- Wedding locations with destination weddings
- The Civil Questline. Specifically the fort takover quests.
- Most miscellaneous quests should count as favors for being thane.
- The deadlands from the Cause creation. This list uses the Cause - Reduced Cut, so the gate is now in the Mehrunes Dagon shrine, and may be opened there if you can figure out how.

## Patch Notes

<div class="centerdiv">
  <hr class="thin-hr">
</div>

### Overview

 - 3.0.0 marks the most significant change in direction for Winds of the North yet. Instead of focusing on adding more content or trying to integrate all of the CC, I have decided to concentrate on improving the base game and making everything feel more consistent. The result is a leaner and more focused modlist.
 
 This update also pushes the visuals a bit closer to the vanilla art style, which has always been important to me. 
 I'll discuss some of the highlights below. Be sure to check out the full changelog as well if you are curious about the finer details.

#### Visual Changes

  - Happy Little Trees has been replaced with a combination of Enhanced Vanilla Trees and Tree Branches 2k
  - Classic Weathers has been removed, and has been replaced with the Vanilla/Custom True storms cut that Winds of the North 1.0.0 used.
  - Community Shader's Skylighting has been added
  - SSGI with just AO (Indirect Lighting has been disabled by default) has been added

#### Quest and Location Changes

  - Wyrmstooth has been removed
  - There has been many small scale quest and immersion tweak mods added, from things like "Neutral Civil War forts", to adding a steward in Dawnstar (yes, Dawnstar did not have a steward)
  - "Favor Quests Separated" and "Miscellaneous Quests are Favors" have been added, and should hopefully make Skyrim's many favor quests a little less painful.
  - Scroll Enchanters have been added to major cities (Thanks again August)

#### CC Integration Changes

  - With 3.0.0, Creation Club integration has had another re-evaluation pass. This was done in the interest of continuing to provide a polished and consistent experience, and not a decision I take lightly. Most of the disabled creations are artifacts from previous games that did not make sense in Skyrim. Others were just creations that I am personally not a fan of.

#### Misc List Tweaks

 - Increased the chances of seeing crossbows on bandits
 - Updated Mo2 to version 2.5.2
 - Switched Mo2 Theme to vs15 Dark
 - Extended Encounters: Public Execution and Thief stealing clothes events have been removed
 - Optimized LOD generation for better performance and size
 - Leather Scout armor is now distributed alongside the other AA armors
 - All bow draw speeds have now been normalized (yes most bows all had different draw speeds in vanilla)
 - You can now block/bash with a staff (Staff Blocking and Bashing by Asrak)
 - TrueHUD's floating bars have been re-enabled by default (they are very useful). The optional file to disable them still remains.

### Bug Fixes

 - Carriages to Hearthfire houses from another Hearthfire House carriage no longer cost gold
 - Fixed an issue where Simply Skin was overwriting textures from CoverKhajiits and F.A.R.
 - Fixed an issue with SMI that caused it to disable fast travel even when Survival Mode was disabled.
 - Fixed an issue with Orcish Scaled Gauntlets by adding Xavbio's cubemap addon
 - Fix Saarthal miners mining in the air
 - The "Warmth" and "Hearthfire" spell tomes now use the correct alteration inventory icon
 - staffExperienceIgnoreEnchantmentCost in scrambled bugs was accidently left set to false.
 - Line and Lure black box is no longer present
