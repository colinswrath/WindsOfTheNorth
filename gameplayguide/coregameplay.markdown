<div style="text-align: center;">
There are many mods in Winds of the North that affect the core gameplay mechanics, and most of these come from the excellent "Simonrim" Gameplay Suite.
<br>
I will try to give a brief overview of the larger changes.

# New Skills
---

Skyrim's skill trees have had a couple of pretty big changes. You should keep these new skills in mind when creating a new character.

## Hand to Hand

</div>

Choosing to take perks in the Hand to Hand skill tree will give you bonuses related to...you guessed it...unarmed combat. Perks include bonuses to unarmed damage, movement speed when unarmed, stamina bonuses, and more.\
This type of build was not really viable long term in vanilla Skyrim.

## Security

</div>

Lockpicking and Pickpocket have been combined into a singualar skill called "Security". Perks in this tree are a much better investment than they were before.

> Security is the art of opening locks and picking pockets. Those who are skilled in Security can find hidden treasures, disarm an unaware target, and silently poison their foes. 

## Dragonborn

# Crafting Changes
---

In Winds of the North, there is a new type of crafting called "Scroll Crafting". Staff Enchanting and Cooking have also recieved major reworks. (thanks to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95196">Sorcerer</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132680">Staff Enchanting Plus</a>)

## Scroll Crafting

## Staff Enchanting

<div class="centerdiv">
    <img src="../assets/siteImages/staffenchant.png" width="70%" style="margin-right: 0.5%;" class="dropshadow">
</div>
<br>

In vanilla, the staff enchanting system functioned sort of like a forge. You had preset recipes that you "crafted". Staff Enchanting Plus allows staff enchanting at the new tables to function like normal enchanting would.\
Mage vendors can now sell unenchanted staves. You can take these staves and enchant them at one of the new tables placed around the game world.

## Cooking

# World Leveling

## Arena

# Survival, Inns, and Fast Travel

## Survival

## Fast Travel

Rather than being completely disabled, fast travel now requires a "Travel Pack".

>  Travel packs can be crafted from any blacksmith's forge, purchased from general merchants, and found occasionally in "clutter" type loot.
