# Winds of the North

This is the repo for hosting the github pages Winds of the North site.

## Frameworks Used

This site was built using Jekyll, files from a custom Jekyll theme called [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). The Lanyon theme itself has also been heavily modified for this site with *some* custom CSS and elements.
Many pages have been tweaked instead of relying soley on Jekyll's theme system.
