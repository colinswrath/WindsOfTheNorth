## Initial Setup

Before reading this guide, please follow the [readme](https://github.com/colinswrath/WindsOfTheNorth/blob/main/README.md) as it will answer the vast majority of technical questions related to getting the list setup and running.

The following summary is not a list of every single mod in the modlist, rather a detailed overview of some of the highlights. 
I just simply can't list everything here as much as I want to (that is what [Load Order Library](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/winds-of-the-north) is for). 

## Overview

Winds of the North is a lightweight modlist that focuses on improving Skyrim’s gameplay and adding new content to experience, while also preserving the aesthetic of the original game.
It also supports many of the Anniversary Edition creations via integration, rebalancing, and quest overhauls to make it feel like it all belongs.
Unsupported creations will be disabled by default.

Essentially, its my own personal modlist I play with that I just really wanted to share.

## Core Mods

Winds of the North is built with the Simonrim Suite of gameplay overhauls at its core.
Almost every part of the game from perks and magic to survival mechanics and combat have been overhauled to bring you a challenging and cohesive experience.

Simonrim can be a bit more challenging than the vanilla game until you "figure things out". I suggest starting out on Apprentice difficulty especially with the added challenge of the accompanying enemy mods.

## Enemies

In Winds of the North, enemies are overhauled by several of the well known simonrim oriented enemy mods such as: 

- [Madmen](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98579) by Oreo
- [Lawless](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88080) by Oreo
- [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) by Delta
- [Dragon Cult](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81422) by Delta
- [King Priest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59652) by ElectricSparx
- [Hokoron](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89212) by Aelix

## Graphics

Winds of the North is not primarily a graphically focused mod list. One of the main goals is to not stray too far from the vanilla aesthetic.

However, it does still utilize quite a few graphical mods to make things look a bit better.

These include, but are not limited to: 

Community Shaders, better vanilla textures with SSEUT, a custom cut of Cathedral Landscapes’ grass, Cathedral 3d flowers, improved snow with Nordic Snow, Xavbio’s awesome armor/weapon retextures, and much more. 

I found the atmosphere of Skyrim’s vanilla weathers to be essential to maintaining the original feel of Skyrim. The main exception here is storms. Winds of the North does improve storms’ visuals and audio using True Storms.

## New Lands, Quests, Content

Winds of the North includes several new lands, dungeons, and quest mods to provide you with plenty of extra content. I was very careful to not include any mods that felt too out of place:

- [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565) by Jonx0r
- [Siege at Icemoth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109541) by RoastGorilla439
- [Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772) by ECSS Dev Group
- [Morthal Barrow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90737) and [Taarengrav Barrow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84371) Penrutet
- Most of [Jayserpa's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727) "Quest Expansion" series provides new ways to complete many vanilla quests.
- [Dark Brotherhood Rising Revengeance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57157/) by EpicCrab

Due to the added difficulty that the core gameplay and enemy mods provide, [Radiant Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45427) and [Timing is Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464) delay some quests to later levels.

## Lines Expansions

After years of playing Skyrim you tend to hear the same lines over and over. Winds of the North utilizes all of [Jayserpa's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727) excellent mods in the "Lines Expansion" series to help shake things up a bit. 

Jonx0r's [Extended Bandit Dialogue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113168), [Extended Guard Dialogue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106523), and [City Bag Checks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112212) mods are also used.

With both of these series of mods you should hear many more voice lines from the denizens of Skyrim.

## Audio and Music

Winds of the North includes Audio Overhaul Skyrim, as well as DylanJames’ other excellent audio mods.

There is also a custom music mix that contains hand picked tracks from: 
- [The Northern Diaries](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28108)
- [Chapter II - Jeremy Soule Inspired Music](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37792) by Dreyma
- [Additional Music](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80277/) by Leon van der Stadt, who also composed the music for Wyrmstooth. 

I made absolutely sure that the music added does not feel out of place next to the original soundtrack. Northern Diaries’ music is composed by Jeremy Soule himself, and Chapter 2 was created using Jeremy Soule’s composing techniques.

## Followers

As of now Winds of the North contains two animal followers, TateTaylorOH's [Gladys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164) and [Merlin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433).

## Creation Club Support

Although Winds of the North requires the Anniversary Edition of Skyrim, not every single creation has been utilized. There are over a dozen mods Winds of the North uses for CC integration so I wont list them all here, but I will discuss some important ones.

- Integration for many of the Creation Club items is provided by Tamrielic Distribution.
- Survival Mode has been completely overhauled by "Survival Mode Improved" by...me! and Starfrost by SimonMagus.
- The Alternative Armors creations have all been integrated into most of the leveled lists by a very heavily modified version of Oreo's [CC Alternative Armors - Quest Removal Enchanted Variants and Proper Distribution for Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75904)
- Many of the Creation Club houses have been overhauled to some degree
- Crossbows are integrated using a combination of "Tamrielic Distribution", "Kachunk", "Thwack" and "Rare Curious Bolts Expanded".
- "Press H to Horse" overhauls vanilla horses as well as the Creation Club's "Wild Horses" and Horse Armors.
- and much more...
