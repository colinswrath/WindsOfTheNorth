## Initial Setup

Before reading this guide, please follow the [readme](https://github.com/colinswrath/WindsOfTheNorth/blob/main/README.md) as it will answer the vast majority of technical questions related to getting the list setup and running.

The following summary is not a list of every single mod in the modlist, rather a detailed overview of some of the highlights. 
I just simply can't list everything here as much as I want to (that is what [Load Order Library](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/winds-of-the-north) is for). 

## Overview

Winds of the North is a lightweight modlist that focuses on improving Skyrim’s gameplay and adding new content to experience, while also preserving the aesthetic of the original game.
It also supports many of the Anniversary Edition creations via integration, rebalancing, and quest overhauls to make it feel like it all belongs.
Unsupported creations will be disabled by default.

Essentially, its my own personal modlist I play with that I just really wanted to share.

## Core Mods

Winds of the North is built with the Simonrim Suite of gameplay overhauls at its core.
Almost every part of the game from perks and magic to survival mechanics and combat have been overhauled to bring you a challenging and cohesive experience.

Simonrim can be a bit more challenging than the vanilla game until you "figure things out". I suggest starting out on Apprentice difficulty especially with the added challenge of the accompanying enemy mods.

## Crusader and Leveling Changes

Crusader is SimonMagus' work-in-progress skill uncapper preset. Though it may seem small, it has some of the most profound effects on the overall feel of the game among all the mods in WotN.

Since there is not a mod page for this yet to serve as documentation, I have included a write-up below that details the changes Crusader makes. (this is a slightly modified version of Simon's summary on Discord).

It's pretty important to understand the changes this mod makes when making your build, so I highly suggest giving this a read. (expand thes tag below)

<Details>
<summary>Crusader Details</summary>

### Overview

 - Crusader is designed to slow the pace of the game significantly, especially at earlier levels, so that players don't breeze past specific areas of the game.
 - This is intended to make the game feel slower-paced.
 - Leveling speed tweaks have been designed with Rested/Well Rested AND Fed/Well-Fed in mind; the player is intended to prioritize these buffs at all times.
 - Leveling speed tweaks have been designed with Reading is Good in mind; the player is intended to acquire skill books to speed mid- to late-game leveling.
 - Crusader is designed to avoid forcing the player to level up "alternate" skills to reach their desired level; the soft cap (level 50) can be reached by leveling only 6 skills.
 - This mitigates some of the other-wise drastic leveling speed changes that the mod makes.

### Leveling Speed

 - Leveling will be much slower throughout the game, but especially in the early game
 - You will no longer rocket past your fist ten levels faster than you can blink
 - The reduction to leveling speed will be lessened as the player levels up (to prevent getting stuck at level 81 for 6 days)
 - The general range is from 80% reduction (at skill level 5) to 50% reduction (at skill level 85)
 - Spells will now receive an XP bonus when dual casting

### Character Level

 - The contribution of skill level to player level is increased for skills above 50
 - Leveling four skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 40
 - Leveling six skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 50
 - Leveling twelve skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 75
 - Leveling eighteen skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 100

### Crafting Skills

 - Leveling crafting skills will give much less progress towards your character level, for crafting skills below 40
 - Leveling crafting skills will give much more progress towards your character level, for crafting skills aboe 60
 - This prevents the player from power leveling early with crafting, and discourages players from interacting with crafting purely for the early levels
 - This also protects the character from having their character level inflated by leveling a skill that contributes little to nothing to their power at low levels
 - The total contribution to your character level for reaching 100 with a crafting skill is identical to all other skills

### Stats, Perks, and Level Caps

 - You will receive 20 Health, Magicka, or Stamina at level 2, based on your choice on level up
 - You will receive 2 perks for reaching level 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45
 - You will receive 3 perks for reaching level 50
 - Level 50 is the "soft cap" for character level. You will no longer receive perks for leveling up after level 50
 - The total number of perks you can receive from leveling is 60
 - You will continue to receive 10 Health, Magicka, or Stamina from levels 51 to 100, based on your choice on level up
 - Level 100 is the "hard cap" for character level. You will no longer receive stat bonuses for leveling up, after level 100
 - The total number of stats you can receive from leveling is 500 (at level 50), and 1000 (at level 100)

### Carry Weight

 - You will start with 200 Carry Weight
 - You will no longer receive Carry Weight for leveling Stamina
 - There are many sources of Carry Weight in Simonrim; use them
 - This change is recommended to be paired with a source of early safe storage

### Tips

 There are a couple of things I think are worth keeping in mind when playing this list with Crusader.

 - The slower leveling speeds are meant to incentivize maintaining your needs bonuses from Starfrost and Gourmet.
 - Keep your Rested/Well Rested/Lover's (10%/25%/50%) Comfort bonuses up to increase your experience gain.
 - Fed/Well Fed/Lover's Cooking will grant you 5%/10%/15% extra experience gain.
 - Between these two buff sources you can maintain a max increase of 75% extra experience gain which is quite substantial.

## Enemies

In Winds of the North, enemies are overhauled by several of the well known simonrim oriented enemy mods such as: 

- [Madmen](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98579) by Oreo
- [Lawless](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88080) by Oreo
- [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) by Delta
- [Dragon Cult](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81422) by Delta
- [King Priest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59652) by ElectricSparx
- [Hokoron](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89212) by Aelix

## Graphics

Winds of the North is not primarily a graphically focused mod list. One of the main goals is to not stray too far from the vanilla aesthetic.

However, it does still utilize quite a few graphical mods to make things look a bit better.

These include, but are not limited to: 

Community Shaders, better vanilla textures with SSEUT, a custom cut of Cathedral Landscapes’ grass, Cathedral 3d flowers, improved snow with Nordic Snow, Xavbio’s awesome armor/weapon retextures, and much more. 

I found the atmosphere of Skyrim’s vanilla weathers to be essential to maintaining the original feel of Skyrim. The main exception here is storms. Winds of the North does improve storms’ visuals and audio using True Storms.

## New Lands, Quests, Content

Winds of the North includes several new lands, dungeons, and quest mods to provide you with plenty of extra content. I was very careful to not include any mods that felt too out of place:

- [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565) by Jonx0r
- [Siege at Icemoth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109541) by RoastGorilla439
- [Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772) by ECSS Dev Group
- [Morthal Barrow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90737) and [Taarengrav Barrow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84371) Penrutet
- Most of [Jayserpa's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727) "Quest Expansion" series provides new ways to complete many vanilla quests.
- [Dark Brotherhood Rising Revengeance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57157/) by EpicCrab

Due to the added difficulty that the core gameplay and enemy mods provide, [Radiant Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45427) and [Timing is Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464) delay some quests to later levels.

## Lines Expansions

After years of playing Skyrim you tend to hear the same lines over and over. Winds of the North utilizes all of [Jayserpa's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727) excellent mods in the "Lines Expansion" series to help shake things up a bit. 

Jonx0r's [Extended Bandit Dialogue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113168), [Extended Guard Dialogue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106523), and [City Bag Checks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112212) mods are also used.

With both of these series of mods you should hear many more voice lines from the denizens of Skyrim.

## Audio and Music

Winds of the North includes Audio Overhaul Skyrim, as well as DylanJames’ other excellent audio mods.

There is also a custom music mix that contains hand picked tracks from: 
- [The Northern Diaries](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28108)
- [Chapter II - Jeremy Soule Inspired Music](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37792) by Dreyma
- [Additional Music](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80277/) by Leon van der Stadt, who also composed the music for Wyrmstooth. 

I made absolutely sure that the music added does not feel out of place next to the original soundtrack. Northern Diaries’ music is composed by Jeremy Soule himself, and Chapter 2 was created using Jeremy Soule’s composing techniques.

I have also included a high definition restoration of vanilla Skyrim's music from [Unofficial High Definition Audio Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18115) to vastly improve the quality. Vanilla SSE's files have pretty bad compression issues.

## Followers

As of now Winds of the North contains two animal followers, TateTaylorOH's [Gladys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164) and [Merlin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433).

## Creation Club Support

Although Winds of the North requires the Anniversary Edition of Skyrim, not every single creation has been utilized. There are over a dozen mods Winds of the North uses for CC integration so I wont list them all here, but I will discuss some important ones.

- Integration for many of the Creation Club items is provided by Tamrielic Distribution.
- Survival Mode has been completely overhauled by "Survival Mode Improved" by...me! and Starfrost by SimonMagus.
- The Alternative Armors creations have all been integrated into most of the leveled lists by a very heavily modified version of Oreo's [CC Alternative Armors - Quest Removal Enchanted Variants and Proper Distribution for Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75904)
- Many of the Creation Club houses have been overhauled to some degree
- Crossbows are integrated using a combination of "Tamrielic Distribution", "Kachunk", "Thwack" and "Rare Curious Bolts Expanded".
- "Press H to Horse" overhauls vanilla horses as well as the Creation Club's "Wild Horses" and Horse Armors.
- and much more...
