## Initial Setup

Before reading this guide, please follow the [readme](https://github.com/colinswrath/WindsOfTheNorth/blob/main/README.md) as it will answer the vast majority of technical questions related to getting the list setup and running.

The following summary is not a list of every single mod in the modlist, rather a detailed overview of some of the highlights. 
I just simply can't list everything here as much as I want to (that is what [Load Order Library](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/winds-of-the-north) is for). 

## Overview

Winds of the North is a lightweight modlist that focuses on improving Skyrim’s gameplay and adding new content to experience, while also preserving the aesthetic of the original game.
It also supports many of the Anniversary Edition creations via integration, rebalancing, and quest overhauls to make it feel like it all belongs.
Unsupported creations will be disabled by default.

Essentially, its my own personal modlist I play with that I just really wanted to share.

## Core Mods

Winds of the North is built with the Simonrim Suite of gameplay overhauls at its core.
Almost every part of the game from perks and magic to survival mechanics and combat have been overhauled to bring you a challenging and cohesive experience.

Simonrim can be a bit more challenging than the vanilla game until you "figure things out". If you are new to Simonrim, I suggest starting no higher than Adept difficulty.

Winds of the North 2.0.0 utilizes Blade and Blunt's "Level Based Difficulty" setting to bring additional challange to the game. As you level up, the game will automatically adjust the difficulty settings in the background to keep things challenging.

## Crusader and Leveling Changes

Crusader is SimonMagus' work-in-progress skill uncapper preset. Though it may seem small, it has some of the most profound effects on the overall feel of the game among all the mods in WotN.

Since there is not a mod page for this yet to serve as documentation, I have included a write-up below that details the changes Crusader makes. (this is a slightly modified version of Simon's summary on Discord).

It's pretty important to understand the changes this mod makes when making your build, so I highly suggest giving this a read. (expand thes tag below)

<Details>
<summary>Crusader Details</summary>

### Overview

 - Crusader is designed to slow the pace of the game significantly, especially at earlier levels, so that players don't breeze past specific areas of the game.
 - This is intended to make the game feel slower-paced.
 - Leveling speed tweaks have been designed with Rested/Well Rested AND Fed/Well-Fed in mind; the player is intended to prioritize these buffs at all times.
 - Leveling speed tweaks have been designed with Reading is Good in mind; the player is intended to acquire skill books to speed mid- to late-game leveling.
 - Crusader is designed to avoid forcing the player to level up "alternate" skills to reach their desired level; the soft cap (level 50) can be reached by leveling only 6 skills.
 - This mitigates some of the other-wise drastic leveling speed changes that the mod makes.

### Leveling Speed

 - Leveling will be much slower throughout the game, but especially in the early game
 - You will no longer rocket past your fist ten levels faster than you can blink
 - The reduction to leveling speed will be lessened as the player levels up (to prevent getting stuck at level 81 for 6 days)
 - The general range is from 80% reduction (at skill level 5) to 50% reduction (at skill level 85)
 - Spells will now receive an XP bonus when dual casting

### Character Level

 - The contribution of skill level to player level is increased for skills above 50
 - Leveling four skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 40
 - Leveling six skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 50
 - Leveling twelve skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 75
 - Leveling eighteen skills to 100 will result in the character reaching level 100

### Crafting Skills

 - Leveling crafting skills will give much less progress towards your character level, for crafting skills below 40
 - Leveling crafting skills will give much more progress towards your character level, for crafting skills above 60
 - This prevents the player from power leveling early with crafting, and discourages players from interacting with crafting purely for the early levels
 - This also protects the character from having their character level inflated by leveling a skill that contributes little to nothing to their power at low levels
 - The total contribution to your character level for reaching 100 with a crafting skill is identical to all other skills

### Stats, Perks, and Level Caps

 - You will receive 20 Health, Magicka, or Stamina at level 2, based on your choice on level up
 - You will receive 2 perks for reaching level 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45
 - You will receive 3 perks for reaching level 50
 - Level 50 is the "soft cap" for character level. You will no longer receive perks for leveling up after level 50
 - The total number of perks you can receive from leveling is 60
 - You will continue to receive 10 Health, Magicka, or Stamina from levels 51 to 100, based on your choice on level up
 - Level 100 is the "hard cap" for character level. You will no longer receive stat bonuses for leveling up, after level 100
 - The total number of stats you can receive from leveling is 500 (at level 50), and 1000 (at level 100)

### Carry Weight

 - You will start with 200 Carry Weight
 - You will no longer receive Carry Weight for leveling Stamina
 - There are many sources of Carry Weight in Simonrim; use them
 - With Candlehearth, every inn has safe storage when renting a room.

### Tips

 There are a couple of things I think are worth keeping in mind when playing this list with Crusader.

 - The slower leveling speeds are meant to incentivize maintaining your needs bonuses from Starfrost and Gourmet.
 - Keep your Rested/Well Rested/Lover's (5%/10%/15%) Comfort bonuses up to increase your experience gain.
 - Fed/Well Fed/Lover's Cooking will grant you 5%/10%/15% extra experience gain.
 - Between these two buff sources you can maintain a max increase of 75% extra experience gain which is quite substantial.

## Enemies

In Winds of the North, there are several mods that add or change existing enemies. With the exception of Dragon War and Humanoid Dragon Priests, enemy mods in WotN 2.0.0 are mostly additional aesthetic rather than rebalance. 

- [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) by Delta. Dragon War makes dragon fights much more difficult, as befits Skyrim's primary source of boss fights.
- [DEAD - Draugr Enemy Asset Diversity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112431) by TateTaylorOH. 
DEAD utilizes some of the "Plague of the Dead" assets to bring visual changes to mainland Draugr. A lesser known bit of Skyrim lore is that some Draugr locations are supposed to be "Dragon War" era Draugr, and other crypts were supposed to come into being much later after the Dragon Cult had already fallen. Despite this, the visuals between all of the Draugr remained the same. DEAD takes the zombie assets and uses them to rework post war Draugr.
- [Cannibal Draugr on Solstheim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21238) by opusGlass. Similarly to DEAD, Cannibal Draugr reworks Draugr visuals but on Solstheim. Draugr there have been redisigned to more closely resemble their counterparts from "Blooodmoon", the Morrowind DLC that also took place on Solstheim.
- [Humanoid Dragon Priests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122320) by Magink. Makes Dragon Priests much more difficult by converting priests into floating humanoids rather than creatures. This avoids a lot of the vanilla priest AI issues.

## Graphics

Winds of the North is not primarily a graphically focused mod list. One of the main goals is to try to preserve the general feeling and atmosphere of the vanilla game.

However, it does utilize quite a few graphical mods to make things look a bit better.

These include, but are not limited to: 

Community Shaders, better vanilla textures with HD Vanilla Landscapes, improved snow with Nordic Snow, Xavbio’s awesome armor/weapon retextures, and much more. 

I found the atmosphere of Skyrim’s vanilla weathers to be essential to maintaining the original feel of Skyrim. The main exception here is storms, which Winds of the North does improve via True Storms.

## New Lands, Quests, Content

Winds of the North includes several new lands, dungeons, and quest mods to provide you with plenty of extra content. I was very careful to not include any mods that felt too out of place:

- [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565) by Jonx0r
- [Siege at Icemoth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109541) by RoastGorilla439
- [Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772) by ECSS Dev Group
- [Morthal Barrow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90737) and [Taarengrav Barrow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84371) Penrutet
- Most of [Jayserpa's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727) "Quest Expansion" series provides new ways to complete many vanilla quests.
- [Destroy The Dark Brotherhood - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118229) by Jayserpa
- [Infiltration - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114054) by Jayserpa
- [Extended Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44810) by jonx0r adds many new world encounters that help make Skyrim feel more alive.
- [Environs Series](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91160) by Siberpunk adds a dynamic aspect to some locations, such as the repair and resettling of the whiterun farmhouse.

Due to the added difficulty that the core gameplay and enemy mods provide, [Radiant Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45427) and an unreleased mod called "Arena Quest Requirements" delay some quests to later levels.

I have listed the details below.

## Lines Expansions

After years of playing Skyrim you tend to hear the same lines over and over. Winds of the North utilizes all of [Jayserpa's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727) excellent mods in the "Lines Expansion" series to help shake things up a bit. 

Jonx0r's [Extended Bandit Dialogue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113168), [Extended Guard Dialogue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106523), and [City Bag Checks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112212) mods are also used.

With both of these series of mods you should hear many more voice lines from the denizens of Skyrim.

## Audio and Music

Winds of the North includes Audio Overhaul Skyrim, as well as DylanJames’ other excellent audio mods.

There is also a custom music mix that contains hand picked tracks from: 
- [The Northern Diaries](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28108)
- [Chapter II - Jeremy Soule Inspired Music](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37792) by Dreyma
- [Additional Music](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80277/) by Leon van der Stadt, who also composed the music for Wyrmstooth. 

I made absolutely sure that the music added does not feel out of place next to the original soundtrack. Northern Diaries’ music is composed by Jeremy Soule himself, and Chapter 2 was created using Jeremy Soule’s composing techniques.

I have also included a high definition restoration of vanilla Skyrim's music from [Unofficial High Definition Audio Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18115) to vastly improve the quality. Vanilla SSE's files have pretty bad compression issues.

## Followers

As of now Winds of the North contains two animal followers, TateTaylorOH's [Gladys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164) and [Merlin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433).

## Creation Club Support

Although Winds of the North requires the Anniversary Edition of Skyrim, not every single creation has been utilized. There are over a dozen mods used for CC integration. They have been listed below, some with additional details.

- Integration for many of the Creation Club items.
- Survival Mode has been completely overhauled by "Survival Mode Improved" by...me! and Starfrost by SimonMagus.
- The Alternative Armors creations have all been integrated into most of the leveled lists by a very heavily modified version of Oreo's [CC Alternative Armors - Quest Removal Enchanted Variants and Proper Distribution for Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75904)
- Many of the Creation Club houses have been overhauled to some degree
- Crossbows are integrated using a combination of "Tamrielic Distribution", "Kachunk", "Thwack" and "Rare Curious Bolts Expanded".
- "Press H to Horse" overhauls vanilla horses as well as the Creation Club's "Wild Horses" and Horse Armors.
> Items that are labeled as "NOT SUPPORTED" simply means that the creation will not be enabled in the list, but the list still requires the Anniversary Edition content to be installed.

> Items labeled as "Unchanged" means that they are enabled and active in the list, but they are left in their vanilla state.
